```

**OG Optimization Examples:**

{
  "home_page_og": {
    "og_title": "Double Your Website Sales with Proven CRO | SenseClinic",
    "og_description": "Stop losing money to poor conversions. Our proven process has helped 500+ businesses increase sales 40-80% in 90 days. See real case studies and get your free audit.",
    "og_image_alt": "Conversion rate optimization results dashboard showing 147% increase",
    "twitter_title": "Proven CRO Process: Double Sales in 90 Days",
    "twitter_description": "See how our conversion optimization increased client sales 40-80%. Real case studies + free audit available."

## URL Structure & Technical SEO

### URL Slug Best Practices

**Slug Structure Standards:**
- Use lowercase letters exclusively
- Separate words with hyphens (not underscores)
- Include primary keyword when natural
- Keep length under 60 characters
- Make human-readable and meaningful
- Avoid stop words when possible ("and", "the", "of")

**URL Slug Examples:**
```markdown
**Good URL Structure:**
/conversion-audit-service
/pricing-packages  
/case-studies/techcorp-lead-generation
/blog/checkout-optimization-guide

**Avoid These Structures:**
/service_page_1 (underscores, not descriptive)
/ConversionAuditServiceForEcommerce (too long, mixed case)
/services/the-complete-guide-to-conversion-rate-optimization-and-testing (too long)
```

### Canonical URL Management

**Canonical Tag Strategy:**
```html
<!-- Home page variations -->
<link rel="canonical" href="https://domain.com/">
<!-- Handles: https://domain.com, https://www.domain.com, https://domain.com/index.html -->

<!-- Service pages -->
<link rel="canonical" href="https://domain.com/conversion-audit">
<!-- Handles: parameter variations, trailing slashes, www variations -->

<!-- Case studies -->  
<link rel="canonical" href="https://domain.com/case-studies/client-name">
<!-- Prevents duplicate content from date-based URLs or category URLs -->
```

**Duplicate Content Prevention:**
- Set canonical URLs for all page variations
- Handle www vs non-www consistently  
- Manage trailing slash variations
- Prevent parameter-based duplicates (?utm_source, etc.)
- Coordinate with localization URL structure

## Internal Linking Strategy

### Conversion-Focused Link Building

**Link Hierarchy Strategy:**
1. **Tier 1 Pages** (Homepage, Main Services) → Most internal links received
2. **Tier 2 Pages** (Service Details, Pricing) → Moderate linking support
3. **Tier 3 Pages** (Case Studies, Blog) → Strategic linking to conversion pages

**Internal Link Anchor Text Formula:**
`[Benefit/Outcome] + [Page Type/Context]`

**Internal Linking Examples:**
```markdown
**From Homepage to Service Page:**
Anchor Text: "comprehensive conversion audit process"  
Context: "Our [comprehensive conversion audit process] identifies exactly what's blocking your sales."

**From Service to Case Study:**
Anchor Text: "see how we increased TechCorp's leads by 147%"
Context: "Want proof this works? [See how we increased TechCorp's leads by 147%] in just 60 days."

**From Case Study to Pricing:**
Anchor Text: "explore our audit packages and pricing"
Context: "Ready for similar results? [Explore our audit packages and pricing] to get started."
```

**Link Distribution Strategy:**
- **Homepage:** Links to all primary service pages + top case studies
- **Service Pages:** Cross-link to related services + relevant case studies + pricing
- **Case Studies:** Link to relevant services + pricing + similar case studies
- **Pricing:** Link back to services + case studies + contact/booking
- **Blog/Content:** Strategic links to conversion-focused pages

## Localization Framework

### Portuguese (pt-PT) Localization Standards

**Language Adaptation Priorities:**
1. **Emotional Triggers** - Maintain Avatar psychological impact in Portuguese
2. **Cultural Context** - Adapt business practices and expectations for Portuguese market
3. **Conversion Language** - Preserve action-driving language effectiveness
4. **Technical Terms** - Balance English business terms vs Portuguese equivalents
5. **Local Proof** - Prioritize European/Portuguese case studies and testimonials

**Localization Examples:**
```markdown
**English (en-US):** "Get Your Free Conversion Audit"
**Portuguese (pt-PT):** "Obter a Sua Auditoria de Conversão Gratuita"

**English (en-US):** "Double your website sales in 90 days"  
**Portuguese (pt-PT):** "Duplique as vendas do seu website em 90 dias"

**English (en-US):** "Join 500+ successful businesses"
**Portuguese (pt-PT):** "Junte-se a mais de 500 empresas bem-sucedidas"
```

**Cultural Adaptation Considerations:**
- **Formality Levels** - Portuguese business culture preferences
- **Trust Signals** - Local certifications, European client logos
- **Pricing Display** - Euro currency, European business norms
- **Contact Methods** - European phone formats, business hours
- **Legal Compliance** - GDPR references, European privacy standards
