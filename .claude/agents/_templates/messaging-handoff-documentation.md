# Messaging Phase â€” Handoff Documentation

This document defines the handoff protocols, data requirements, and quality standards for the Messaging Phase agents working on Email & WhatsApp automation sequences.

## Overview

The Messaging Phase transforms website copy and strategy into executable automation sequences covering:
- **NO-PAY Sequence**: 5-step email nurture (D0+20m, D1, D3, D5, D7) with optional WhatsApp
- **CUSTOMER Sequence**: Welcome, onboarding, and support messaging across email and WhatsApp
- **Compliance Package**: GDPR, deliverability, and template approval requirements
