## Copy Framework & Strategy

### Voice & Tone Foundation

Based on Avatar VoC research, establish:

```yaml
voice_profile:
  personality: ""           # e.g., "Professional yet approachable"
  expertise_level: ""       # e.g., "Expert without intimidation"  
  emotional_tone: ""        # e.g., "Confident and reassuring"
  language_style: ""        # e.g., "Clear, direct, benefit-focused"

customer_language:
  pain_words: ["", "", ""]             # How they describe problems
  solution_words: ["", "", ""]         # How they describe desired outcomes
  objection_phrases: ["", "", ""]      # Common hesitation language
  success_language: ["", "", ""]       # How they describe wins
```

### Conversion Copy Formula

**HERO SECTION STRUCTURE:**
1. **Hook** - Attention grabbing headline (problem/outcome focused)
2. **Promise** - Clear value proposition subheadline  
3. **Proof** - Trust signal or credibility indicator
4. **Primary CTA** - Action + outcome with urgency/value

**BENEFIT BULLETS (Rule of 3):**
- Lead with outcome/benefit, not feature
- Use Avatar's language for problems and solutions
- Include proof points where possible
- Format: "Benefit → How → Proof"
