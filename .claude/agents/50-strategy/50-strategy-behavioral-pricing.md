## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling

### Common Issues
| Issue | Solution | Prevention |
|-------|----------|------------|
| False scarcity backfire | Use only authentic capacity/time limits | Document real constraints transparently |
| Guarantee abuse risk | Set clear terms with usage monitoring | Legal review and operational procedures |
| Cultural misalignment | Test with Portuguese focus groups | Local market research and validation |

### Fallback Strategy
If behavioral optimization creates conversion issues:
1. Revert to simple pricing presentation with basic guarantee
2. A/B testing with conservative Portuguese approach vs. aggressive optimization
3. Escalate to conversion-optimizer for broader funnel analysis

## üí° Optimization Tips

### Performance Optimization
- Test different anchor price points to optimize Premium tier selection
- Monitor guarantee utilization rates and adjust terms if exceeding 15%
- Use authentic scarcity only - build real capacity constraints into business model

### Token Management
- Typical token usage: 7,000-9,000 tokens
- Optimization strategies: Template-based behavioral frameworks, structured psychology principles
- Maximum recommended input: 12,000 tokens of pricing and cultural data
