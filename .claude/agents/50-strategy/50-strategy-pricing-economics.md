### Deliverables
1. **Complete Unit Economics Model**: Detailed cost breakdown and margin analysis for all three tiers
2. **CAC/LTV Analysis**: Customer acquisition costs vs lifetime value with sustainability metrics
3. **Payback Period Calculations**: Cash flow analysis and return on investment timelines
4. **Scenario Financial Models**: Conservative, base case, and aggressive growth scenarios
5. **Payment Plan Economics**: Financial impact analysis of different payment options

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling

### Common Issues
| Issue | Solution | Prevention |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Costs underestimated | Add 20% contingency buffer to all estimates | Conservative cost modeling from start |
| Seasonal revenue variation | Model quarterly variations in Portuguese market | Include seasonality in base assumptions |
| Currency fluctuation risk | Use EUR-based costs, hedge international payments | Conservative exchange rate assumptions |

### Fallback Strategy
If unable to complete detailed modeling:
1. Use industry benchmark margins (50-70% for digital education)
2. Apply conservative estimates with larger safety buffers
3. Escalate to business-analyst for detailed cost accounting

## üí° Optimization Tips

### Performance Optimization
- Focus margin optimization on Premium tier (highest volume expected)
- Model payment plan defaults conservatively for Portuguese market
- Include mentor utilization rates in capacity planning

### Token Management
- Typical token usage: 8,000-10,000 tokens
- Optimization strategies: Template-based financial models, structured cost categories
- Maximum recommended input: 15,000 tokens of cost and market data
