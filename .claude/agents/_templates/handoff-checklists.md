## Escalation Protocols

### Missing Data Escalation
**Trigger:** Required data unavailable after agent research  
**Action:** Tag owning agent with specific questions and 48-hour deadline  
**Fallback:** Mark as assumption with confidence level and collection priority

### Quality Standard Failure
**Trigger:** Output doesn't meet minimum quality requirements  
**Action:** Return to agent with specific improvement checklist  
**Timeline:** 24-hour turnaround for revisions

### Conflicting Information
**Trigger:** Contradictory claims between agent outputs  
**Action:** Request evidence from both agents and arbitrate based on source quality  
**Resolution:** Document decision rationale in change log

### Technical Limitation Discovery
**Trigger:** Recommended approach not technically feasible  
**Action:** Inventory & Access Steward provides alternative approaches  
**Update:** Measurement Mapper revises requirements accordingly
