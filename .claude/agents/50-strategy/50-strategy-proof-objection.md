### Deliverables
1. **Complete Objection Map**: Systematic mapping of 5 primary objection categories to specific proof assets
2. **Proof Asset Library**: Organized collection of testimonials, case studies, and credibility indicators

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling

### Common Issues
| Issue | Solution | Prevention |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Testimonial consent issues | Secure written permission for all usage | Legal consent forms from start |
| Bonus margin impact | Calculate true cost before design | Economics validation for all bonuses |
| Proof asset authenticity questions | Verify all claims with documentation | Third-party verification process |

### Fallback Strategy
If insufficient proof assets available:
1. Use founder credentials and methodology explanation as primary credibility
2. Create conservative projections based on pilot program results
3. Escalate to customer-insights for additional testimonial collection

## üí° Optimization Tips

### Performance Optimization
- Prioritize video testimonials for Portuguese market trust building
- Use local geographic and business context in testimonials for relatability
- Design bonuses that genuinely reduce implementation time or difficulty

### Token Management
- Typical token usage: 8,000-10,000 tokens
- Optimization strategies: Template-based objection mapping, structured proof categorization
- Maximum recommended input: 15,000 tokens of customer and proof data
