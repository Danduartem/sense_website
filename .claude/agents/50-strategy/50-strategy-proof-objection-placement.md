### Placement Principles
```markdown
| Principle | Description | Example | Impact |
|-----------|-------------|---------|---------|
| Proximity | Place proof near objection | Price near ROI calculator | +40% conversion |
| Relevance | Match proof to audience segment | PT testimonials for PT traffic | +25% trust |
| Freshness | Recent proof over old | "Last week" vs "Last year" | +30% credibility |
| Specificity | Specific over generic | "‚Ç¨12,847" vs "5-figures" | +50% believability |
| Variety | Different proof types | Video + Text + Data | +35% coverage |
```

### Proof Sequencing Logic
```javascript
const PROOF_SEQUENCE = {
  'awareness_to_interest': [
    'Authority proof', // Establish credibility
    'Social proof', // Show others succeeded
    'Results proof' // Demonstrate outcomes
  ],
  'interest_to_desire': [
    'Transformation proof', // Show journey
    'Similarity proof', // "Just like you"
    'Method proof' // How it works
  ],
  'desire_to_action': [
    'Urgency proof', // Limited availability
    'Guarantee proof', // Remove risk
    'Bonus proof' // Extra value
  ],
  'action_to_advocacy': [
    'Success proof', // Quick wins
    'Community proof', // Not alone
    'Progress proof' // Continuous results
  ]
}
