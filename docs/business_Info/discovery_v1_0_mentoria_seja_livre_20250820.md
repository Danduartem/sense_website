- **Income Range:** R$20,000/month
- **Location:** Middle-class urban Brazil and Portugal

**Daily Context:**
Amanda wakes up before dawn, checking messages before her 5-year-old daughter gets up. She's constantly balancing client demands, team management, and family responsibilities. Despite working 12+ hour days, she feels like she's running on a hamster wheel - lots of motion, little progress toward her dreams of financial freedom and work-life balance. She presents a polished exterior to the world while internally questioning if she'll ever escape the trap of trading time for money.

**Emotions & Psychology:**
