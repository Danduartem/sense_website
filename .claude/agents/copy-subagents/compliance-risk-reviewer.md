### Claims Verification Standards

**Claim Risk Assessment Categories:**

**High-Risk Claims (Require Immediate Attention):**
- Specific percentage improvements without statistical backing
- Guaranteed outcomes or results promises

- Time-bound promises ("in 30 days") without success rate disclosure
- Income or ROI claims without disclaimers and proof
- Comparison claims against competitors without substantiation

**Medium-Risk Claims (Require Review):**
- "Typical results" or "average outcomes" without representative data
- Success story claims without proper consent and verification
- Expert or authority claims without credential backing
- Industry-specific claims without relevant experience proof
- Process effectiveness claims without outcome correlation

**Low-Risk Claims (Acceptable with Verification):**
- Client testimonials with proper consent and attribution
- Company achievements with documentation (awards, certifications)
- Process descriptions without outcome guarantees
- Team qualifications with proper credential backing
- Service offerings matching actual capabilities

## Risk Assessment Methodology

### High-Risk Language Identification

**Red Flag Phrases to Avoid or Modify:**
- "Guaranteed results" → "Our proven process typically achieves..."
- "Works for everyone" → "Effective for businesses meeting [criteria]"
- "Instant results" → "Many clients see improvements within [timeframe]"
- "Best in industry" → "Recognized expertise in [specific area]"
- "Never fails" → "Consistently effective when properly implemented"
- "Unlimited" (anything) → Specific limitations and terms

**Superlative Claims Verification:**
```markdown
**Before:** "We're the #1 conversion optimization agency"
**After:** "We're a leading conversion optimization agency with 500+ successful client engagements"
**Rationale:** Removes unverifiable ranking claim while maintaining credibility

**Before:** "Guaranteed to double your sales"  
**After:** "Our process has helped many clients significantly increase their sales"
**Rationale:** Removes guarantee while maintaining benefit focus
```
