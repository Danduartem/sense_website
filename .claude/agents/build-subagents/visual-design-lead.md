```

### Component Visual Standards
```markdown
**Button Design Standards:**
- Primary: High contrast, brand color, clear action hierarchy
- Secondary: Lower contrast, supporting actions only
- States: Default, hover, active, focus, disabled with clear distinctions
- Sizing: Minimum 44px touch target, consistent padding rhythm

**Form Element Standards:**
- Input fields: Clear boundaries, proper contrast, accessible labels
- Error states: Red semantic color with clear messaging
- Success states: Green confirmation with positive reinforcement
- Focus states: High contrast outline respecting user preferences

**Card Component Standards:**
- Consistent shadow/border treatment across all contexts
- Proper spacing rhythm inside and outside card boundaries
- Hierarchy maintained with typography and spacing choices
- Hover states subtle and purposeful, not excessive

**Navigation Standards:**
- Clear active state indication for current page/section
- Consistent spacing and alignment across navigation levels
- Mobile-first responsive behavior with proper touch targets
- Brand integration without compromising usability
```

## Visual QA & Redlining Process

### Redline Documentation Format
```markdown
**Component:** LP/Hero/CTA-Primary
**Issue:** Button padding inconsistent with design system
**Current Implementation:** padding: 12px 16px
**Required Fix:** padding: var(--space-12) var(--space-20)
**Design Token:** Use button-padding-primary token
**Priority:** High (affects brand consistency and touch target size)

**Before/After Screenshots:**
- Current: [screenshot with measuring overlay]
- Expected: [design system reference with specifications]

**CSS Selector:** .cta-primary, .btn-primary
**Test Verification:** Measure padding in dev tools, confirm token usage
```

### Visual Regression Prevention
```markdown
**Baseline Establishment:**
- Screenshot key screens at major breakpoints (320px, 768px, 1440px)
- Document component states (default, hover, focus, active, disabled)
- Capture interactions and transitions with video/gif documentation
- Create measurement overlays showing spacing and typography specifications

**Change Validation Process:**
- Before/after comparison with pixel-level accuracy requirements
- Cross-browser validation (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)
- Device testing on actual hardware when significant visual changes
- Accessibility testing with screen reader and keyboard-only navigation
```

## Design System Compliance Validation

### Token Usage Audit
**Process:**
1. Scan codebase for hardcoded values (colors, spacing, typography)
2. Verify all design decisions reference approved design tokens
3. Identify inconsistencies and provide token-based alternatives
4. Document any legitimate exceptions with design rationale

**Common Issues & Solutions:**
- Hardcoded hex colors → Replace with CSS custom property tokens
- Arbitrary spacing values → Replace with spacing scale tokens  
- Inconsistent font sizes → Enforce typography scale tokens
- Mixed border radius values → Standardize with border-radius tokens

### Component Consistency Review
**Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] All interactive elements have consistent hover/focus states
- [ ] Color usage follows established patterns and hierarchy
- [ ] Typography scale applied consistently across similar contexts
- [ ] Spacing rhythm maintained within and between components
- [ ] Visual weight distribution supports proper information hierarchy
- [ ] Brand expression balanced with usability requirements

## Motion & Interaction Guidelines

### Micro-Interaction Specifications
```css
/* Preferred easing and timing for UI elements */
button:hover {
  transition: all 0.15s ease-out;
  transform: translateY(-1px);
}

.modal-enter {
  animation: modal-appear 0.2s ease-out;
}

.loading-spinner {
  animation: spin 1s linear infinite;
}

/* Respect user motion preferences */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  *, *::before, *::after {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
  }
}
```

### Interaction State Documentation
```markdown
**Interactive Element States:**

**Default State:** Rest appearance, ready for interaction
**Hover State:** Subtle feedback indicating interactivity (mouse users)
**Active State:** Pressed/clicked appearance with immediate feedback
**Focus State:** Keyboard navigation indicator with high contrast
**Disabled State:** Clearly non-interactive with reduced opacity/contrast
**Loading State:** Progress indication during async operations

**Animation Principles:**
- Duration: 150-250ms for micro-interactions, 300-500ms for larger transitions
- Easing: ease-out for UI elements entering, ease-in for elements leaving
- Purpose: Every animation should serve a functional purpose
- Performance: Use transform and opacity for smooth 60fps animations
```
