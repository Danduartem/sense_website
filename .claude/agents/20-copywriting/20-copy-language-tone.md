## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling

### Common Issues
| Issue | Solution | Prevention |
|-------|----------|------------|

1. Use established Portuguese copywriting best practices as baseline
2. Conduct focused language research with 5-10 customers
3. Test different language approaches with A/B testing framework
