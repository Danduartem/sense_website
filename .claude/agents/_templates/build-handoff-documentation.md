## Handoff Timing & Dependencies

### Sequential Handoffs
1. **VDL** completes art direction → **RDSE** implements responsive design tokens
2. **RDSE** establishes component library → **FEI** implements components
3. **FEI** creates components with hooks → **IDE** implements integrations
4. **All agents** complete implementation → **QRR** validates and deploys

### Parallel Work Streams
- **VDL** and **RDSE** can work simultaneously on design system establishment
- **FEI** and **IDE** can work in parallel once component interfaces are defined
- **QRR** can establish CI/CD pipeline while other agents are implementing
