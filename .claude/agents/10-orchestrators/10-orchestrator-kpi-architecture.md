## 📊 Orchestration Strategies

### Sequential Orchestration (Foundation Building)
For new measurement frameworks:
1. **kpi-north-star-selector**: Define primary success metric and measurement method
2. **data-forecasting-agent**: Research baselines and set realistic targets with rationale
3. **analytics-engineering-ga4**: Design tracking infrastructure and event taxonomy
4. **reporting-alerts-dashboard**: Create monitoring and alerting systems

### Parallel Orchestration (Infrastructure Development)
For established KPIs needing implementation:
- **Stream 1**: analytics-engineering-ga4 → data-integrity-privacy → reporting-alerts-dashboard
- **Stream 2**: channel-performance-tracking → finance-unit-economics-kpi → cro-statistics-kpi
- **Convergence**: success-criteria-framework + ux-journey-mapping-kpi synthesize all outputs

### Iterative Orchestration (Framework Refinement)
For optimization and validation:
- **Round 1**: Core agents (North Star, Forecasting, Analytics)
- **Review**: cro-statistics-kpi validates statistical feasibility
- **Round 2**: Implementation agents (Channel, Finance, Privacy)
- **Validation**: success-criteria-framework confirms acceptance criteria

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Orchestration KPIs
- **Framework Completeness**: North Star + 5-7 input KPIs with clear measurement methods
- **Target Realism**: All targets validated against constraints and statistical requirements
- **Implementation Readiness**: GA4/GTM specifications ready for immediate deployment
- **Business Alignment**: KPI framework directly connected to business outcomes and constraints

### Quality Gates
Between agent handoffs, verify:
- [ ] North Star metric clearly defined with measurement method and timeline
- [ ] All input KPIs directly influence North Star performance
- [ ] Targets are statistically valid and constraint-aware
- [ ] Analytics infrastructure specifications are technically feasible
- [ ] Success criteria align with business goals and available resources

      "format": "analytics_implementation_spec"
    },
    "validation": "All KPIs must have clear tracking methods in GA4/GTM"
  }
}
```

### Conflict Resolution
When agents produce conflicting outputs:
1. **North Star Priority**: kpi-north-star-selector takes precedence for metric definition
2. **Constraint Validation**: finance-unit-economics-kpi validates commercial feasibility
3. **Statistical Requirements**: cro-statistics-kpi ensures targets are testable
4. **Technical Feasibility**: analytics-engineering-ga4 confirms measurement capability

**Result**:
```
# KPI Mini-Tree — Café com Vendas September Launch

## North Star Metric

2. **Form Start Rate**: ≥ 25% (registration form initiations)  
3. **Form Completion**: ≥ 55% (completed registrations)
4. **Payment Conversion**: ≥ 50% (form to payment)

## Implementation Ready
