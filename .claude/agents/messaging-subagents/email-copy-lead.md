## Email Copy Framework

### Subject Line Optimization

**A/B Testing Strategy:**
```yaml
Subject A: [Direct benefit/outcome focus]
Subject B: [Curiosity/intrigue focus]

Examples:
A: "Your 5-minute conversion fix is ready"
B: "The tiny change that doubled Sarah's signups"
```

**Spam Avoidance Guidelines:**
- Avoid ALL CAPS, excessive punctuation (!!!!), or money symbols
- Limit promotional words (FREE, GUARANTEED, LIMITED TIME)
- Focus on value/benefit rather than sales language
- Test deliverability before deployment

**Personalization Standards:**
```yaml
Basic: "{{ first_name }}, your audit results..."
Advanced: "{{ first_name }}, your {{ primary_metric }} fix..."
Fallback: "Your audit results..." (when merge field fails)
```

### Email Body Structure

**Opening Hook** (First 1-2 sentences):
- Address Avatar's immediate pain point or desired outcome
- Reference their recent action (form submission, download, etc.)
- Create curiosity gap to encourage full email reading

**Value Delivery** (Main body):
- Provide specific, actionable insight or solution
- Use bullet points for scanability on mobile
- Include social proof or credibility indicators where relevant
- Address one key objection naturally within content flow

**Primary CTA** (Call-to-Action):
- Single focus per email (no competing actions)
- Action + Outcome formula: "Book My Strategy Call"
- Urgency or scarcity where authentic: "This Week Only"
- Mobile-optimized button text and placement

**Email Signature/Footer:**
- Unsubscribe link (legally required)
- Company contact information
- Social proof elements (awards, certifications)

## Merge Field Strategy

### Standard Merge Fields
```json
{
  "first_name": {
    "default": "there",
    "purpose": "Personal greeting"
  },
  "avatar_title": {
    "default": "business owner", 
    "purpose": "Role-based personalization"
  },
  "primary_metric": {
    "default": "results",
    "purpose": "Outcome-specific language"
  },
  "company_name": {
    "default": "your business",
    "purpose": "Business context personalization"
  },
  "lead_source": {
    "default": "our website", 
    "purpose": "Attribution context"
  }
}
```

### Fallback Strategy
- Always provide meaningful defaults that maintain email flow
- Test all merge field combinations before deployment
- Use conditional logic when available: "Hi {{ first_name | default: 'there' }}"
- Avoid obviously templated language in fallbacks

## CTA Optimization for Email

### Email CTA Best Practices

**Action Verbs for Email:**
- "Book" (discovery calls, consultations)
- "Access" (dashboards, materials, content)
- "Download" (guides, resources, tools)
- "Claim" (limited offers, spots, bonuses)
- "Get" (results, strategy, customized plan)
- "Start" (process, transformation, journey)

**Outcome Clarity:**
- "Book My Strategy Call" (not "Schedule Appointment")
- "Access My Dashboard" (not "Login Here")
- "Download Complete Guide" (not "Get Resource")
- "Claim My Audit Spot" (not "Apply Now")

**Email-Specific CTAs:**
- Consider email client rendering (buttons vs links)

- Contrasting colors that work in dark/light mode
- Clear visual hierarchy with surrounding white space
