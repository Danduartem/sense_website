## 🎯 Advanced Segmentation Rules

### RFM Segmentation (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)
```python
# RFM Scoring for Email Engagement
def calculate_rfm_score(subscriber):
    recency_score = {
        'last_7_days': 5,
        'last_14_days': 4,
        'last_30_days': 3,
        'last_60_days': 2,
        'over_60_days': 1
    }
    
    frequency_score = {
        'daily_opener': 5,
        'weekly_opener': 4,
        'biweekly_opener': 3,
        'monthly_opener': 2,
        'rare_opener': 1
    }
    
    monetary_score = {
        'high_ticket_buyer': 5,
        'multi_buyer': 4,
        'single_buyer': 3,
        'attempted_buyer': 2,
        'never_attempted': 1
    }
    
    return {
        'segment': assign_segment(r, f, m),
        'priority': calculate_priority(r, f, m),
        'strategy': recommend_strategy(r, f, m)
    }
```

### Dynamic Segmentation Triggers
```javascript
// Real-time segment updates
const dynamicTriggers = {
  'moved_to_hot_lead': {
    trigger: 'Visited checkout page',
    action: 'Start abandonment sequence in 1 hour',
    cap: 'Max 3 emails in 72 hours'
  },
  'engagement_drop': {
    trigger: 'No opens in 14 days (was active)',
    action: 'Re-engagement campaign',
    cap: 'Max 2 emails in 7 days'
  },
  'vip_qualifier': {
    trigger: 'Opened 10 consecutive emails',
    action: 'Add to VIP segment + exclusive content',
    cap: 'No frequency cap'
  },
  'sunset_candidate': {
    trigger: 'No engagement in 90 days',
    action: 'Final re-engagement attempt',
    cap: '1 email then suppress'
  }
};
```

## 🚫 Suppression & Frequency Rules

### Master Suppression List
```yaml
Global Suppressions:
  Hard Bounces:
    Action: Immediate removal
    Reactivation: Never
    
  Spam Complaints:
    Action: Immediate suppression
    Reactivation: Never
    
  Unsubscribes:
    Action: Honor immediately
    Reactivation: Only with explicit re-consent
    
  Role Accounts:
    Pattern: [info@, admin@, noreply@]
    Action: Never send
    
  Competitors:
    List: [Manually maintained]
    Action: Exclude from all campaigns
```

### Frequency Capping Matrix
```markdown
| Segment | Daily Max | Weekly Max | Monthly Max | Notes |
|---------|-----------|------------|-------------|--------|
| VIP/Engaged | 2 | 7 | 20 | Can handle more |
| Standard | 1 | 4 | 12 | Default limits |
| Re-engaging | 1 | 2 | 4 | Gentle approach |
| New Subscriber | 1 | 5 | 10 | Front-loaded |
| Customer | 1 | 3 | 10 | Post-purchase care |
| At Risk | 0 | 1 | 2 | Minimal touch |
```

### Smart Suppression Logic
```python
# Fatigue prevention algorithm
def should_suppress(subscriber, campaign):
    # Check global suppressions
    if subscriber in global_suppression_list:
        return True
    
    # Check frequency caps
    sends_today = count_sends(subscriber, 'today')
    if sends_today >= frequency_cap['daily']:
        return True
    
    # Check engagement health
    if engagement_score < 20 and campaign.type != 're_engagement':
        return True
    
    # Check time zone optimization
    if not in_optimal_send_window(subscriber.timezone):
        return 'Delay'
    
    # Check campaign conflicts
    if has_conflicting_campaign(subscriber, campaign):
        return True
    
    return False
```
