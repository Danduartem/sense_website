async function checkGA4Insights() {
  const insights = await fetch(`https://analyticsdata.googleapis.com/v1beta/properties/${PROPERTY_ID}:runReport`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      dateRanges: [{ startDate: '7daysAgo', endDate: 'today' }],
      dimensions: [{ name: 'date' }],
      metrics: [
        { name: 'sessions' },

  });
  
  const data = await insights.json();
  
  // Analyze for anomalies and trends
  const anomalies = detectPerformanceAnomalies(data);
  
  if (anomalies.length > 0) {
    await sendAnomalyAlert(anomalies);
  }
}
```

#### Slack Integration for Real-Time Alerts

// Slack webhook integration for team notifications
async function sendSlackAlert(alertData) {
  const slackMessage = {
    channel: '#cafe-com-vendas-alerts',
    text: `üö® ${alertData.severity.toUpperCase()} Alert: ${alertData.title}`,
    attachments: [{
      color: alertData.severity === 'critical' ? 'danger' : 'warning',
      fields: [
        {
          title: 'Metric',
          value: alertData.metric,

```

## Monitoring Infrastructure & Maintenance

### Data Freshness & Quality Monitoring
```javascript
// Automated data quality checks
const DATA_QUALITY_CHECKS = {
  "event_freshness": {
    check: "latest event timestamp within last 30 minutes",
    frequency: "every 15 minutes",
    alert_threshold: "no events for >30 minutes"
  },
  
  "revenue_consistency": {
    check: "GA4 purchase revenue vs Stripe revenue <5% difference",
    frequency: "daily",
    alert_threshold: ">10% difference for 2+ consecutive days"
  },
  
  "conversion_rate_stability": {
    check: "daily conversion rate within 2 standard deviations of 7-day average",
    frequency: "daily",
    alert_threshold: "outside range for 2+ consecutive days"
  },
  
  "utm_attribution_completeness": {
    check: "utm_source parameter present in >90% of paid traffic",
    frequency: "daily",
    alert_threshold: "<80% attribution for paid channels"
  }
};
```

### Performance Optimization & Scaling
```javascript
// Dashboard performance optimization
const DASHBOARD_OPTIMIZATION = {
  caching_strategy: {
    real_time_data: "cache for 5 minutes",
    daily_aggregates: "cache for 1 hour", 
    weekly_reports: "cache for 4 hours",
    monthly_summaries: "cache for 24 hours"
  },
  
  data_sampling: {
    real_time_monitoring: "100% of data",
    daily_reports: "100% of data", 
    weekly_analysis: "sampling for large date ranges",
    historical_trends: "aggregated data for >90 days"
  },
  
  load_balancing: {
    peak_hours: "distribute queries across time windows",
    concurrent_users: "queue management for dashboard access",
    alert_processing: "priority queue for critical alerts"
  }
};
```
```

### Deliverables
1. **Complete GA4 Exploration Suite**: Comprehensive funnel analysis, campaign performance, and real-time monitoring reports
2. **Multi-Tier Dashboard Framework**: Daily operations, weekly review, and executive summary dashboards with automated refresh
3. **Intelligent Alert System**: Three-tier alert configuration with automated monitoring and escalation protocols

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling

### Common Issues
| Issue | Solution | Prevention |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Dashboard data delays | Implement data freshness monitoring with automatic fallback to cached data | Set up redundant data sources and alert for data pipeline issues |
| False positive alerts | Adjust thresholds based on historical variance and business context | Use rolling averages and statistical significance testing for alert triggers |
| Alert fatigue | Implement alert severity tiers and escalation protocols | Regular alert effectiveness review and threshold optimization |

### Fallback Strategy
If dashboard infrastructure fails:
1. Use manual GA4 interface with pre-configured exploration templates
2. Implement basic email alerts with GA4 Intelligence API
3. Create simplified spreadsheet-based monitoring with daily manual updates
4. Plan for infrastructure recovery with enhanced monitoring and redundancy

## üí° Optimization Tips

### Performance Optimization
- Use GA4 real-time reporting for immediate decision-making with daily aggregates for trend analysis
- Configure intelligent alert thresholds that balance early warning with actionable response capability
- Design dashboard hierarchy that serves different decision-making timelines and organizational levels
- Implement automated data quality monitoring to ensure reporting accuracy and reliability

### Token Management
- Typical token usage: 5,000-7,000 tokens
- Optimization strategies: Focus on critical dashboard specifications with practical implementation guidance
- Maximum recommended input: Analytics infrastructure + KPI targets + business decision-making requirements

## üìö Example Outputs

### Example 1: Caf√© com Vendas Daily Operations Dashboard
**Input**: 8 registrations target, real-time monitoring requirements
**Output**: 
```html
<!-- Daily Dashboard Configuration -->
<dashboard id="cafe-com-vendas-daily">

    <card title="Form Completion" metric="52%" target="‚â•55%" status="needs-attention"/>
    <card title="Payment CVR" metric="60%" target="‚â•50%" status="excellent"/>
  </metric-cards>
  
  <alerts>
    <alert severity="medium" metric="Form Completion Rate" 
           message="Below target for 4 hours - investigate mobile UX"/>
  </alerts>
</dashboard>

// Alert Configuration
ALERT: Form completion <40% for >6 hours
‚Üí Notify: UX Designer, Tech Lead
‚Üí Action: Check mobile form usability, validate tracking
‚Üí Response: 4 hours
