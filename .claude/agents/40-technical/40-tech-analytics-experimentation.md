### Deliverables
1. **Complete Tracking Setup**: GA4 and GTM configuration with all conversion events and funnel measurement
2. **A/B Testing Framework**: Experiment design templates with statistical requirements and success metrics
3. **Success Metrics Dashboard**: KPI definition with targets, measurement methods, and reporting automation
4. **GDPR Compliance Framework**: Consent management and data retention policies for Portuguese market
5. **Experimentation Roadmap**: Prioritized testing schedule with optimization opportunities

## ⚠️ Error Handling

### Common Issues
| Issue | Solution | Prevention |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Tracking data gaps | Implement redundant tracking methods | Regular data validation checks |
| GDPR compliance violations | Strict consent management implementation | Legal review of tracking practices |
| Statistical significance errors | Required sample size calculations | Proper experiment design protocols |

### Fallback Strategy
If analytics implementation fails:
1. Use basic Stripe analytics for revenue tracking
2. Manual conversion tracking through customer surveys
3. Escalate to gtm-analytics-tracker for advanced implementation

## 💡 Optimization Tips

### Performance Optimization
- Implement server-side tracking for better data accuracy
- Use GA4 custom audiences for retargeting optimization
- Set up automated alerts for immediate issue detection

### Token Management
- Typical token usage: 10,000-12,000 tokens
- Optimization strategies: Template-based tracking configurations, structured experiment designs
- Maximum recommended input: 18,000 tokens of business and technical requirements
