## üìã Angle Selection Process

### Step 1: Audience Assessment
```json
{
  "awareness_analysis": {
    "level": "solution-aware", 
    "indicators": ["knows problem exists", "researching solutions", "comparing options"],
    "readiness": "evaluating specific approaches"
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Objection Mapping
```json
{
  "primary_objection": "Price concerns for ‚Ç¨1797 investment",
  "underlying_fears": ["not getting ROI", "can't afford failure", "better cheaper options"],
  "objection_category": "investment_skepticism"
}
```

### Step 3: Context Integration
```json
{
  "section_context": "hero",
  "goal": "capture attention and drive to CTA",
  "constraints": ["mobile-first", "premium positioning", "female entrepreneur context"]
}
```

### Step 4: Angle Selection Logic
1. **Primary angle**: Best match for awareness level
2. **Secondary angle**: Best match for objection type  
3. **Tertiary angle**: Complementary approach for diversity

### Step 5: Diversity Validation
Ensure selected angles differ in at least 2 dimensions:
- **Tone**: Emotional vs rational vs aspirational
- **Structure**: Problem-first vs solution-first vs proof-first
- **Psychology**: Fear vs desire vs logic vs belonging
- **Proof usage**: Heavy vs moderate vs light social proof

## üéØ Quality Assurance

### Selection Validation Checklist
- [ ] All 3 angles address the primary objection differently
- [ ] Angles suit the stated awareness level
- [ ] Tone variety spans emotional range appropriately  
- [ ] Structure variety offers genuine choice
- [ ] Psychology triggers don't overlap significantly
- [ ] All angles are culturally appropriate for Portuguese market
- [ ] Angles align with premium brand positioning (‚Ç¨1797)

### Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- ‚ùå Three variations of the same angle
- ‚ùå Angles that ignore stated objections
- ‚ùå Inappropriate complexity for awareness level  
- ‚ùå Cultural mismatches (aggressive sales for Portuguese women)
- ‚ùå Brand misalignment (discount positioning for premium offer)

## üé® Portuguese Market Considerations

### Cultural Angle Adaptations
- **Authority**: Subtle confidence, not aggressive dominance
- **Empathy**: Family/life balance themes resonate strongly
- **Clarity**: Premium simplicity, not bare-bones efficiency
- **Identity**: Community over individual achievement 
- **Time**: Work-life integration, not productivity obsession
- **Obstacle**: Gentle problem-solving, not confrontational

### Language Pattern Preferences  
- **Tu form**: Creates intimacy and connection
- **Metaphors**: Transformation, journey, growth (not war/battle)
- **Proof style**: Concrete but understated, not American hype
- **Emotional range**: Warm professionalism, not cold efficiency

Focus on strategic distinctiveness: each angle should feel like a completely different marketing approach while targeting the same audience need.
