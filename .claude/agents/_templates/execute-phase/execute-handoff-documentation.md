## Critical Implementation Notes

### Design System First Approach
- **Token System:** All designs built on design tokens - implement token system before individual components
- **Component Library:** Build reusable components that can be composed into page layouts
- **Consistency:** Use components consistently across pages to maintain design system integrity

### Measurement Implementation
- **Event Tracking:** Every interactive element must fire tracking events as specified
- **PII Compliance:** No personal information in analytics events - use ID mapping system
- **Test Mode:** Implement test_mode parameter to exclude development/QA data from production analytics
- **QA Validation:** Test all events in development environment before launch

### Accessibility Priority
- **WCAG 2.1 AA:** Non-negotiable requirement for all interactive elements
- **Focus Management:** Keyboard navigation must be logical and visible
- **Screen Readers:** All content must be accessible to assistive technologies
- **Testing:** Use automated tools AND manual testing with screen readers

### Performance Requirements
- **Image Optimization:** Use WebP/AVIF formats with fallbacks, lazy loading for below-fold images
- **Critical Path:** Inline critical CSS, defer non-critical resources
- **Mobile Performance:** Optimize specifically for mobile devices and slower connections
- **Metrics:** Target <3s load time on 3G connections

**Cross-Browser Testing:**
- [ ] Chrome (latest 2 versions)
- [ ] Firefox (latest 2 versions)  
- [ ] Safari (latest 2 versions)
- [ ] Edge (latest 2 versions)
- [ ] Mobile browsers on iOS and Android

**Performance Testing:**
- [ ] Page load times under 3 seconds on 3G
- [ ] Images optimized and properly sized
- [ ] Critical rendering path optimized
- [ ] No render-blocking resources above the fold

**Analytics Testing:**
- [ ] All measurement events fire correctly
- [ ] Event parameters match specifications
- [ ] test_mode exclusion working properly
- [ ] Conversion goals properly configured
