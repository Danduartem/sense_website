## Customer Temperature Framework

### Temperature Stage Definitions

**Cold Traffic (Awareness Stage)**
- First-time visitors with minimal trust
- Problem-aware but solution-unaware
- High skepticism, low commitment threshold
- Require education and credibility building
- Best offers: Low-risk, high-value content

**Warm Traffic (Consideration Stage)**  
- Return visitors or referred prospects
- Solution-aware and evaluating options
- Medium trust, moderate commitment level
- Comparing alternatives and gathering proof
- Best offers: Consultations, assessments, demos

**Hot Traffic (Decision Stage)**
- High-intent prospects ready to purchase
- Provider-aware and evaluation complete
- High trust, high commitment threshold
- Need specific pricing and implementation details
- Best offers: Core services, premium packages

## Offer Mapping Matrix

### Offer Categories by Temperature

**Cold-Stage Offers (Trust Building)**
```yaml
offer_type: "lead_magnet"
examples: ["strategy_guide", "assessment_tool", "case_study_pack", "webinar_series"]
value_proposition: "Free education and tools"
commitment_level: "email_address"
conversion_goal: "email_capture"
nurture_path: "educational_sequence"
```

**Warm-Stage Offers (Qualification)**
```yaml
offer_type: "consultation"  
examples: ["strategy_session", "audit_call", "needs_assessment", "demo_presentation"]
value_proposition: "Personalized analysis and recommendations"
commitment_level: "scheduled_time"
conversion_goal: "sales_qualified_lead"
nurture_path: "consideration_sequence"
```

**Hot-Stage Offers (Core Services)**
```yaml

examples: ["done_for_you", "implementation", "training_program", "retainer_package"]  
value_proposition: "Complete solution delivery"
commitment_level: "financial_investment"
conversion_goal: "paying_customer"
nurture_path: "onboarding_sequence"
```

## CTA Strategy Framework

### Primary CTA Rules

**One Primary CTA Per Page:**
- No competing actions that create decision paralysis
- Primary CTA gets prominent placement and design emphasis
- All other actions are clearly secondary/supporting

**CTA Hierarchy by Page Type:**
```yaml
home: ["get_consultation", "learn_more"]
service_detail: ["request_quote", "view_case_studies"]  
case_study: ["similar_results", "get_consultation"]
about: ["work_with_us", "see_approach"]
blog_post: ["get_guide", "subscribe_newsletter"]
contact: ["schedule_call", "send_message"]
pricing: ["get_started", "custom_quote"]
```

### Secondary CTA Guidelines

**Journey Progression Support:**
- Provide alternative paths for different commitment levels
- Offer value-first interactions (content, tools, resources)
- Create stepping stones toward primary conversion
- Never compete with or distract from primary goal

**Temperature-Appropriate Secondaries:**
- Cold: Content offers, newsletter signup, social follow
- Warm: Case studies, testimonials, FAQ access, demo video  
- Hot: Pricing details, implementation timeline, guarantee terms

## Offer & CTA Mapping Schema

### Mapping Matrix Row Structure

```yaml
journey_stage: ""                # cold|warm|hot
page_type: ""                    # From SIANL page taxonomy
primary_offer: ""                # Main value proposition
primary_cta: ""                  # Primary action button
secondary_cta: ""                # Supporting action (optional)  
placement: ["", "", ""]          # Where CTAs appear on page
value_prop: ""                   # Benefit-focused messaging
risk_reversal: ""                # Guarantee or risk reduction
urgency_element: ""              # Scarcity or time sensitivity
```

**Example Mapping:**
```yaml
journey_stage: "warm"
page_type: "service_detail"  
primary_offer: "strategy_consultation"
primary_cta: "book_consultation"
secondary_cta: "view_case_studies"
placement: ["hero", "after_benefits", "bottom_page"]
value_prop: "Get custom strategy for your specific situation"
risk_reversal: "No-obligation consultation with actionable insights"
urgency_element: "Limited slots available this month"
```

## CTA Optimization Principles

### Psychology-Driven CTA Design

**Action-Oriented Language:**
- Use strong action verbs (Get, Discover, Transform, Unlock)
- Be specific about outcome (not just "Learn More")
- Create anticipation of value delivery
- Match avatar language and terminology

**Benefit-Focused Messaging:**
- Lead with value received, not action required
- Address primary motivation or pain point
- Promise specific outcome or transformation
- Use first-person perspective when appropriate

**Risk Reduction Elements:**
- No-obligation qualifiers where appropriate
- Social proof integration (testimonials, reviews)
- Guarantee or risk-reversal statements
- Process transparency (what happens next)

### CTA Testing Framework

**Elements to Optimize:**
- Button copy and action language
- Color contrast and visual prominence  
- Placement timing and page position
- Size and surrounding white space
- Supporting microcopy and context

**A/B Testing Priorities:**
1. Primary CTA copy (benefit vs. action focused)
2. Button placement (above fold vs. natural breaks)
3. Color psychology (urgency vs. trust colors)
4. Supporting text (risk reduction vs. benefit focus)
5. Form length (information vs. conversion balance)

## Page-Specific CTA Strategy

### Home Page CTA Strategy
```yaml
primary_goal: "Qualification and education"
primary_cta: "get_consultation" 
placement: ["hero", "after_social_proof", "final_conversion"]
secondary_options: ["view_services", "read_case_studies", "download_guide"]
temperature_focus: "cold_to_warm_conversion"
```

### Service Detail CTA Strategy  
```yaml
primary_goal: "Sales qualified lead generation"
primary_cta: "request_quote"
placement: ["hero", "after_method", "after_proof", "bottom"]
secondary_options: ["view_similar_cases", "see_pricing", "ask_question"]
temperature_focus: "warm_to_hot_conversion"
```

### Case Study CTA Strategy
```yaml
primary_goal: "Social proof to consultation"
primary_cta: "get_similar_results"  
placement: ["after_challenge", "after_results", "bottom"]
secondary_options: ["view_related_services", "see_all_cases"]
temperature_focus: "proof_to_consideration"
```

## Offer Positioning Strategy

### Value Ladder Construction

**Low-Barrier Entry (Cold)**
- Free resources and educational content
- Self-service tools and assessments
- Newsletter with ongoing value delivery
- Social media following and engagement

**Medium-Commitment Qualification (Warm)**

- Webinars and educational events
- Free trials or pilot programs

**High-Value Core Services (Hot)**
- Done-for-you service packages
- Implementation and consulting retainers
- Training programs and certifications
- Premium support and ongoing management

### Risk Reversal Integration

**Guarantee Types by Offer Level:**
- Content: "Actionable insights or money back"
- Consultation: "Valuable recommendations guaranteed"  
- Service: "Results achievement or partial refund"
- Retainer: "Cancel anytime with 30-day notice"
