## üöÄ Activation Examples

### How to activate this orchestrator:
```
"Use the user-journey-map-orchestrator to map the complete customer journey"
"Have user-journey-map-orchestrator create a detailed journey map with all touchpoints"
"Use user-journey-map-orchestrator for comprehensive journey analysis and optimization"
```

### Ideal for orchestrating:
- Complete user journey mapping from awareness to advocacy
- Multi-path journey analysis (Ad Lead, Organic Lead, Checkout Abandon, Customer Onboarding)
- Conversion optimization through journey insights
- Personalization and localization strategy development

## üîÑ Orchestration Planning Process

**MANDATORY: Always follow this orchestration process:**

1. **Decompose** journey into 5 stages and 4 branching paths
2. **Map** agent dependencies for comprehensive analysis
3. **Allocate** agents to specific journey stages and components
4. **Coordinate** agent outputs into unified journey map
5. **Synthesize** into actionable journey table with metrics

```
**Use when**: Optimizing existing journey
**Expected duration**: 30-40 minutes

## üìä Orchestration Strategies

### Sequential Orchestration
For complete journey mapping:
1. **Journey Architecture**: Define 5 stages and 4 branching paths
2. **VoC & Triggers**: Extract customer insights and triggers
3. **Proof & Objection Placement**: Map objections to stages
4. **UX & IA**: Design user flows and information architecture
5. **Metrics & Instrumentation**: Define KPIs and tracking
6. **Personalization**: Add Portuguese localization
7. **Experimentation**: Design tests and validation
8. **Technical Integration**: Specify implementation

### Parallel Orchestration
For faster delivery:
- **Stream 1**: Journey Architecture ‚Üí VoC ‚Üí Proof Mapping
- **Stream 2**: Metrics Planning ‚Üí Technical Requirements
- **Convergence**: UX & IA synthesizes both streams
- **Finalization**: Personalization and Experimentation

### Iterative Orchestration
For refinement:
- **Round 1**: Initial journey mapping (first 4 agents)
- **Review**: Validation against business goals
- **Round 2**: Enhancement (remaining 4 agents)
- **Validation**: Final quality check

## üéØ Success Metrics

### Orchestration KPIs
- **Journey Completeness**: 100% coverage of 5 stages
- **Path Coverage**: All 4 branching paths documented
- **Objection Mapping**: 100% of major objections addressed
- **Metric Definition**: GA4 events for all key actions
- **Localization**: Portuguese adaptations for all stages

### Quality Gates
Between agent handoffs, verify:
- [ ] All 5 journey stages documented
- [ ] All 4 branching paths defined
- [ ] Customer goals and objections mapped
- [ ] Proof points assigned to stages
- [ ] CTAs defined for each stage
- [ ] GA4 events specified
- [ ] Friction risks identified
- [ ] Owners assigned

## üîó Agent Handoff Specifications

### Data Flow Protocol
```json
{
  "handoff_format": {
    "from_agent": "journey-architecture",
    "to_agent": "voc-triggers",
    "data": {
      "required_fields": ["stages", "paths", "entry_points"],
      "optional_fields": ["success_criteria", "constraints"],
      "format": "JSON"
    },
    "validation": "All 5 stages and 4 paths defined"
  }
}
```

### Conflict Resolution
When agents produce conflicting outputs:
1. **Priority Rules**: Customer data > Business goals > Technical constraints
2. **Merge Strategy**: Combine insights, prioritize by conversion impact
3. **Escalation Path**: Request clarification on critical conflicts

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Orchestration Error Handling

### Agent Failure Recovery
| Failed Agent | Fallback Option | Recovery Strategy |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| journey-architecture | Manual stage definition | Use standard 5-stage template |
| voc-triggers | Historical customer data | Use existing research |
| proof-objection-placement | Generic objection library | Apply common objections |
| ux-ia-journey | Standard UX patterns | Use best practices |
| metrics-instrumentation | Basic GA4 setup | Apply default events |

### Timeout Management
- Individual agent timeout: 10 minutes
- Total workflow timeout: 60 minutes
- Timeout action: Complete with available data

## üí° Orchestration Optimization

### Efficiency Tips
- **Batch Processing**: Run VoC and Metrics agents in parallel
- **Caching Strategy**: Reuse customer research across stages
- **Parallel Limits**: Max 3 concurrent agents

### Resource Management
- Token budget per agent: 8,000
- Total token budget: 64,000
- Priority allocation: VoC and Journey Architecture get 25% each
