## Evidence Classification & Verification

### Evidence Types & Strength Hierarchy
```markdown
**Tier 1 - Strongest Evidence:**
- Client case studies with documented metrics and timelines
- Video testimonials with face, name, company, specific outcomes
- Screenshot proof of results (analytics, revenue, metrics)
- Third-party validation (awards, certifications, press coverage)

**Tier 2 - Strong Evidence:**
- Written testimonials with full attribution (name, title, company)
- Before/after comparisons with quantified improvements
- Client logos with permission and relationship context
- Industry recognition and professional credentials

**Tier 3 - Supporting Evidence:**
- Anonymous testimonials with outcome specificity
- Aggregated statistics from client base
- Process documentation and methodology proof
- Team credentials and experience indicators

**Tier 4 - Weak Evidence (Use Cautiously):**
- Generic testimonials without specifics
- Unverifiable claims or statistics
- Stock photos or generic imagery
- Self-reported metrics without validation
```

### Claim Verification Framework
```markdown
**Verification Process:**
1. **Identify Claim**: Extract specific assertion being made
2. **Evidence Requirement**: Define what proof would substantiate claim
3. **Available Evidence**: Catalog existing proof materials
4. **Gap Analysis**: Identify missing or insufficient evidence
5. **Conservative Reframe**: Provide alternative phrasing if evidence lacks
6. **Usage Rights**: Ensure legal permission for all evidence usage

**Example Verification:**
Claim: "Increase leads by 200% in 30 days"
Required Evidence: Client case with before/after lead metrics, timeline documentation, attribution permission
Available Evidence: Client email mentioning "big improvement in leads"
Gap Analysis: No specific percentages, timeline, or metrics verification
Conservative Reframe: "Significantly increase lead generation" or "Help clients improve lead results"
```

## Testimonial Curation Strategy

### Avatar-Aligned Testimonial Selection
```markdown
**Selection Criteria:**
- **Demographic Match**: Similar industry, company size, role to Avatar
- **Problem Alignment**: Specific mention of Avatar's key pain points  
- **Outcome Specificity**: Quantified results with timelines when possible
- **Emotional Language**: Authentic voice showing transformation impact
- **Credibility Markers**: Full attribution with verifiable contact details

**Outcome Categories to Prioritize:**
- Revenue/profit improvements with specific numbers
- Time savings with quantified efficiency gains
- Process improvements with before/after descriptions
- Personal transformation with emotional and practical benefits
- Competitive advantages gained through solution implementation
```

### Testimonial Structure & Formatting
```markdown
**Optimal Testimonial Format:**
"[Specific outcome achieved with metrics/timeline] - I was [initial state/objection] but [solution/process description] helped me [transformation result]. [Emotional impact statement]."
- [Full Name], [Title], [Company], [Location if relevant]

**Example Strong Testimonial:**
"Increased qualified leads by 180% in just 45 days - I was skeptical about another marketing system, but the step-by-step process and weekly check-ins helped me finally crack the code on consistent lead generation. Now I wake up to new prospects in my inbox every morning."
- Sarah Mitchell, Marketing Director, TechStart Solutions, Austin TX

**Weak Testimonial to Avoid:**
"Great service, highly recommend!"
- John D.
```

### Testimonial Placement Strategy
```markdown
**Strategic Positioning:**
- **Hero Section**: Brief credibility testimonial or aggregate metric
- **Social Proof Strip**: Short outcome-focused quotes with attribution
- **After Problem Section**: Testimonials that validate pain points
- **After Solution Section**: Testimonials that confirm method effectiveness
- **Before Pricing**: Strong ROI/value testimonials to justify investment
- **FAQ Section**: Testimonials that address common objections
- **Final CTA**: Transformation testimonials that reinforce promise
```

**Qualification Language:**
- "Many of our clients experience..."
