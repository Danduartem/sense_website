# Execute Dev Phase — Handoff Documentation Template

## Overview

This template provides standardized handoff documentation for the Execute Dev phase, ensuring seamless transitions between the **Engineering Program Lead (EPL)** orchestrator and the 5 specialized development subagents.

## Agent Handoff Matrix

### Sequential Gate Dependencies

```
FE-UI → ui_ok → FCI → integrations_ok → ATE → analytics_ok → BWE → backend_ok → DQE → release_ok
```

Each gate must **pass** before the next agent can begin work. No bypassing allowed.

## Quality Gates Enforcement

### Gate Progression Rules
1. **Sequential Dependency**: Later gates cannot start until earlier gates pass
2. **No Bypass**: All criteria must be met for gate passage
3. **Evidence Required**: Each gate requires documented proof of completion
4. **Rollback Triggers**: Gate failures trigger rollback to fix issues

### Cross-Gate Validation
- **Traceability**: PAGE/SECTION/COMP IDs consistent across all outputs
- **Performance**: Budgets maintained throughout all implementations
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance verified at each stage
- **Security**: No vulnerabilities introduced at any implementation stage

### Final Acceptance Criteria

**Development System Complete When:**
- [ ] All 5 gates passed with documented evidence
- [ ] End-to-end user journeys tested and functional
- [ ] Core Web Vitals green on production environment
- [ ] Analytics tracking verified with no PII exposure
- [ ] Integration reliability proven through load testing
- [ ] Security implementation validated through penetration testing
- [ ] Documentation complete with runbooks and troubleshooting guides

## Escalation Procedures

### Issue Classification
- **Blocker**: Prevents gate progression, requires immediate attention
- **High**: Impacts multiple systems, needs resolution within 24 hours  
- **Medium**: Affects single system, resolve within 48 hours
- **Low**: Minor issues, resolve in next sprint

### Escalation Path
1. **Agent Level**: Issue identified by implementing agent
2. **EPL Review**: Escalated to Engineering Program Lead for coordination
3. **Cross-Agent**: Multiple agents involved in resolution
4. **External**: Requires stakeholder or vendor involvement

### Resolution Documentation
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Document underlying cause
- **Fix Implementation**: Detail solution applied
- **Prevention Measures**: Steps to avoid recurrence
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Update runbooks and documentation

Remember: This handoff documentation ensures seamless coordination between all Execute Dev phase agents while maintaining quality standards, performance requirements, and delivery timelines. Each handoff must be complete before the next agent begins work.
