## ⚠️ Error Handling

### Common Issues
| Issue | Solution | Prevention |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Incomplete constraint data | Use conservative estimates and clearly mark assumptions | Always request specific numerical constraints |
| Overly optimistic assumptions | Apply 20% buffer to all estimates and timelines | Validate assumptions against historical data |
| Insufficient risk mitigation | Develop multiple contingency plans for high-impact risks | Focus on actionable mitigation strategies |

### Fallback Strategy
If unable to get specific constraint information:
1. Use industry benchmarks for Portuguese small business constraints
2. Apply conservative estimates with clear assumption documentation
3. Focus on highest-impact risks with basic mitigation plans

## 💡 Optimization Tips

### Performance Optimization
- Focus on constraints that most limit growth potential
- Prioritize risks with both high probability and high impact
- Create actionable mitigation plans that don't require major additional resources

### Token Management
- Typical token usage: 2,500-4,000 tokens
- Optimization strategies: Focus on top 3-5 most critical constraints and risks
- Maximum recommended input: Business context + constraint data + risk scenarios
