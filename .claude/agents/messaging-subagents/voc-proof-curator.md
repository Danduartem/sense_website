   - Risk Level: HIGH - requires Level 1 proof

2. "Join 500+ successful clients"
   - Evidence Required: Client database count, success definition

   - Risk Level: MEDIUM - requires Level 2 proof

3. "Award-winning conversion specialists"

5. **Recommendation** - Why they'd recommend to others

SenseClinic's audit identified 3 specific friction points and provided 
step-by-step fixes [SOLUTION]. Within 30 days, our conversion rate 
increased from 2.3% to 4.1% [QUANTIFIED RESULTS]. The stress of

## Claims-to-Evidence Mapping

### Messaging Claims Audit

**NO-PAY Sequence Claims Verification:**
```json
{
  "sequence": "NO-PAY",
  "claims_audit": [
    {
      "step": "D1 Value Email",
      "claim": "5-minute fix to unblock conversions",
      "evidence_required": "Case study showing quick implementation result",
      "proof_status": "verified",
      "evidence": {
        "type": "case_study",
        "client": "Sarah Martinez",
        "specific_fix": "Trust badge implementation", 
        "implementation_time": "5 minutes",
        "result": "35% reduction in abandonment within 24 hours"
      }
    },
    {
      "step": "D3 Objections Email", 
      "claim": "Most businesses see results within 30 days",
      "evidence_required": "Aggregated client data with methodology",
      "proof_status": "needs_verification",
      "action": "Gather data from last 20 clients, calculate average time to results"
    },
    {
      "step": "D5 Case Study Email",
      "claim": "Client increased conversions by 78%",
      "evidence_required": "Full case study with analytics proof",
      "proof_status": "verified",
      "evidence": {
        "type": "case_study_complete",
        "client": "TechStart Academy",
        "before": "1.3% conversion rate",
        "after": "2.3% conversion rate", 
        "percentage_increase": "77% (rounded to 78%)",
        "timeframe": "45 days",
        "methodology": "Google Analytics, 3-month comparison"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Conservative Reframing Guidelines

**When Proof is Insufficient:**
```markdown
Original Claim: "Guaranteed 50% increase in conversions"
Conservative Reframe: "Most clients see significant conversion improvements within 60 days"

Original Claim: "Triple your revenue in 30 days"
Conservative Reframe: "Our proven audit process helps identify the biggest revenue leaks"

Original Claim: "Works for any business" 
Conservative Reframe: "Particularly effective for course creators and digital service providers"
```

## Proof Integration for Messaging Channels

### Email Integration Guidelines

**Subject Line Proof:**
- "How [Client Name] got [Specific Result]" (requires full case study)
- "[Number] businesses already using this fix" (requires database count)
- "The method behind [Client's] success" (requires methodology documentation)

**Email Body Proof Placement:**
```markdown
Opening: Light social proof ("Join 200+ course creators...")
Middle: Specific case study or testimonial  
CTA: Results promise backed by guarantee ("See similar results or money back")
Footer: Credentials/certifications for credibility
```

### WhatsApp Integration Guidelines

**Character-Optimized Proof:**
- Short testimonial excerpts with attribution
- Single powerful metric with context
- Visual proof (screenshots) when possible
- Quick credential mentions in signature

**WhatsApp Proof Examples:**
```markdown
"Just helped Maria increase signups by 65% in 3 weeks! 
Similar results possible for your course too.
Want the same strategy? ðŸ‘†"
```
