## üìä Orchestration Strategies

### Sequential Orchestration
For building pricing foundation:
1. **Market Intelligence**: Competitive landscape + WtP analysis ‚Üí pricing ranges
2. **Pricing Economics**: Validate margins and payback ‚Üí viable price points  
3. **Offer Architecture**: Design tiers and inclusions ‚Üí structured offering
4. **Behavioral Packaging**: Apply psychology ‚Üí final pricing strategy

### Parallel Orchestration
For specialized implementation:
- **Stream 1**: Proof & Objection ‚Üí Sales Communications
- **Stream 2**: Legal Policy ‚Üí Compliance validation
- **Stream 3**: Payments Setup ‚Üí Analytics Setup
- **Convergence**: Final synthesis into complete pricing sheet

### Iterative Orchestration
For quality optimization:
- **Round 1**: Core agents produce initial outputs
- **Review**: Validation against acceptance criteria
- **Round 2**: Refinement based on gaps
- **Validation**: Final quality check and PMM approval

## üéØ Success Metrics

### Orchestration KPIs
- **Pricing Sheet Completeness**: 100% of 16 required sections
- **Market Compliance**: Portuguese market optimization verified
- **Economic Validation**: All tiers meet >40% margin targets  
- **Legal Compliance**: GDPR/Portuguese consumer law adherence
- **Conversion Optimization**: Behavioral triggers implemented

### Quality Gates
Between agent handoffs, verify:
- [ ] Previous agent output includes all required data fields
- [ ] Portuguese market optimizations applied appropriately
- [ ] Price integrity rules maintained (no random discounting)
- [ ] Legal claims substantiated with evidence
- [ ] Stripe integration technically feasible

## üîó Agent Handoff Specifications

### Data Flow Protocol
```json
{
  "handoff_format": {
    "market_intelligence_to_economics": {
      "required_fields": ["competitive_pricing", "wtp_range", "market_risks"],
      "format": "JSON with PT market adjustments"
    },
    "economics_to_architecture": {
      "required_fields": ["price_points", "margin_targets", "payback_periods"],
      "format": "Structured pricing framework"
    },

```

### Conflict Resolution
When agents produce conflicting outputs:
1. **Priority Rules**: Economics agent overrides on margin conflicts, Legal agent overrides on compliance
2. **Merge Strategy**: Combine complementary insights, escalate fundamental conflicts  
3. **Escalation Path**: PMM orchestrator makes final decisions on strategic trade-offs

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Orchestration Error Handling

### Agent Failure Recovery
| Failed Agent | Fallback Option | Recovery Strategy |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| market-pricing-intelligence | Use existing market data + conservative estimates | Proceed with 20% margin buffer |
| pricing-economics | Apply standard SaaS margins (60-80%) | Validate with simplified unit economics |
| offer-architecture | Use proven 3-tier template | Adapt existing successful structures |
| behavioral-pricing | Apply standard psychological triggers | Use anchoring + guarantee basics |
| payments-checkout | Manual Stripe setup documentation | Provide configuration checklist |

### Timeout Management
- Individual agent timeout: 10 minutes maximum
- Total workflow timeout: 45 minutes maximum  
- Timeout action: Proceed with available outputs, flag incomplete sections

## üí° Orchestration Optimization

### Efficiency Tips
- **Batch Processing**: Run proof-objection, legal-policy, payments-checkout in parallel after behavioral pricing
- **Caching Strategy**: Reuse market intelligence across multiple cohorts with date validation
- **Parallel Limits**: Maximum 3 agents concurrent to maintain quality

### Resource Management
- Token budget per agent: 8,000 tokens average
- Total token budget: 75,000 tokens maximum
- Priority allocation: Architecture and economics agents get higher token allocation

## üìö Orchestration Examples

### Example 1: Lisbon Cohort Launch
**Request**: "Create complete pricing strategy for Caf√© com Vendas Lisbon cohort targeting female entrepreneurs"

**Orchestration Plan**:
1. **Market Intelligence**: Analyze Portuguese competitive landscape, local payment preferences, pricing sensitivity
2. **Economics + Architecture**: Validate 3-tier structure (‚Ç¨400/‚Ç¨800/‚Ç¨1200) with 50%+ margins
3. **Behavioral + Proof + Legal**: Apply anchoring psychology, map objections, ensure GDPR compliance
4. **Payments + Analytics + Comms**: Configure MB WAY/SEPA, set tracking, create sales copy

**Result**: Complete 16-section pricing sheet ready for immediate implementation

### Example 2: International Expansion
**Request**: "Adapt existing pricing for Brazilian market expansion"

**Orchestration Plan**:
1. **Market Intelligence**: Research Brazilian competitive landscape, payment methods (PIX), pricing norms
