      content_type: ""       # Description of content needed
      cta_included: false    # Boolean - does this module have a CTA?
      copy_slots: ["", ""]   # List of copy elements needed
      
  breakpoints:
    mobile_375:              # Mobile behavior

## Wireframe Standards

### Layout Principles
- **F-Pattern Reading**: Important content follows natural eye movement
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Information revealed in logical hierarchy
- **Single Path**: Clear next-step guidance without decision paralysis
- **Thumb-Friendly**: Mobile interactions within comfortable reach zones

### CTA Placement Rules
- **Primary CTA**: Above-the-fold on every page, repeated strategically
- **Secondary CTAs**: Support primary action, don't compete
- **CTA Spacing**: Adequate white space around action elements
- **Progressive CTAs**: Increase in prominence as user scrolls

### Content Hierarchy
1. **Hook** (immediate attention grabber)
2. **Promise** (clear value proposition)  
3. **Proof** (credibility and trust signals)
4. **Process** (how it works/what happens next)
5. **Pricing** (transparent cost structure)
6. **Objection Handling** (FAQ or risk reversal)
7. **Final CTA** (last chance conversion)

## Responsive Design Requirements

### Mobile-First Approach (375px)
- Single column layout for all content
- Stack modules vertically with clear separation
- Primary CTA visible without scrolling
- Touch-friendly button sizes (min 44px height)
- Readable text without zooming (16px+ base)

### Tablet Adaptation (744px)

- Optimize for both portrait and landscape

### Desktop Optimization (1280px)

- Larger hero sections with more visual impact
- Advanced interactions where beneficial

## Common Wireframe Patterns

### High-Converting Page Structures

**Service Detail Page Flow:**
1. Hero with value proposition + primary CTA
2. Problem/solution alignment
3. Methodology or process steps  
4. Deliverables and outcomes
5. Social proof (testimonials/results)
6. FAQ objection handling
7. Final CTA with urgency/scarcity

**Pricing Page Flow:**
1. Hero with pricing promise
2. Package comparison table
3. Feature breakdown by tier
4. Success stories by package
5. FAQ for common pricing objections  
6. Money-back guarantee or risk reversal
7. Contact/consultation CTA

**Case Study Detail Flow:**
1. Hero with client spotlight and results
2. Challenge/situation background
3. Solution and methodology applied
4. Implementation process and timeline
5. Results and outcomes achieved
6. Client testimonial or quote
7. "Get similar results" CTA

## Success Criteria

**Clarity**: Every page purpose and user action is immediately obvious
**Conversion-Focused**: Single clear path to primary conversion goal
**Responsive**: Optimal experience across all device types and sizes  
**Scalable**: Module system allows for easy content updates and additions
**User-Centered**: Information architecture matches user mental models and needs

Remember: Your wireframes are the foundation for all subsequent design and development work. Prioritize clarity, conversion optimization, and responsive behavior above all else. Every design decision should be justified by user needs and business goals.
