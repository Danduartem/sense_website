## Copy Framework & Strategy

### Voice & Tone Foundation

Based on Avatar VoC research, establish and maintain:

```yaml
voice_profile:
  personality: ""           # e.g., "Professional yet approachable"
  expertise_level: ""       # e.g., "Expert without intimidation"  
  emotional_tone: ""        # e.g., "Confident and reassuring"
  language_style: ""        # e.g., "Clear, direct, benefit-focused"

customer_language:
  pain_words: ["", "", ""]             # How they describe problems
  solution_words: ["", "", ""]         # How they describe desired outcomes
  objection_phrases: ["", "", ""]      # Common hesitation language
  success_language: ["", "", ""]       # How they describe wins
  energy_level: ""                     # Conversational energy and pace
```

### Conversion Copy Formula

**HERO SECTION STRUCTURE:**
1. **Hook** - Attention-grabbing headline (problem/outcome focused, Avatar language)
2. **Promise** - Clear value proposition subheadline (specific outcome + time/method)
3. **Proof** - Trust signal or credibility indicator (social proof, stats, logos)
4. **Primary CTA** - Action + outcome with urgency/value (single focus per page)

**BENEFIT BULLETS (Rule of 3):**
- Lead with outcome/benefit, not feature descriptions
- Use Avatar's exact language for problems and solutions
- Include proof points where available from VPC
- Format: "Benefit → How → Proof" (verb-first construction)

In fact, 87% of our clients initially worried about fit, but our personalized discovery process ensures the strategy works for your exact situation (PROOF). Here's how our customization process works: [brief explanation with specific steps]."
