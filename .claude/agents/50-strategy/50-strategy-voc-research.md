### Deliverables

2. **Verbatim Quote Library**: Organized collection of authentic customer quotes with attribution and themes

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling

### Common Issues
| Issue | Solution | Prevention |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Limited customer data access | Expand survey outreach, social media monitoring | Regular customer feedback collection systems |
| Language barriers in research | Native Portuguese speaker involvement | Cultural consultation for nuanced insights |
| Biased sample representation | Multiple source triangulation | Demographic diversity monitoring |

### Fallback Strategy
If primary VoC sources are insufficient:
1. Leverage competitive customer analysis and market research reports
2. Conduct focused interviews with 5-10 customers for depth over breadth
3. Use proxy research from similar markets (Spain, Italy) with cultural adaptation

## üí° Optimization Tips

### Performance Optimization
- Prioritize recent customer interactions (last 6 months) for relevance
- Focus on emotional language and specific examples over general feedback
- Look for patterns across multiple sources to validate insights

### Token Management
- Typical token usage: 8,000-10,000 tokens
- Optimization strategies: Template-based analysis, structured categorization
- Maximum recommended input: 15,000 tokens of raw customer data
