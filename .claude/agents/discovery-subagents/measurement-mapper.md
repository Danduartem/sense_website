    parameters: ["", ""]
    source: ""
  filters: ["", ""]
  time_period: ""
  data_destinations: ["", ""]
  calculation_notes: ""
  known_limitations: ["", ""]
```

## Appendix C: Naming Conventions

### C.1 Event Naming Standards

**Format:** `action_object_context`

**Examples:**
```yaml
user_actions:
  - page_view
  - form_submit
  - button_click
  - video_play
  - download_start

ecommerce_events:
  - product_view
  - cart_add
  - checkout_start
  - purchase_complete
  - subscription_renew

engagement_events:
  - email_open
  - email_click
  - content_share
  - lead_qualify
  - demo_request
```

### C.2 Parameter Naming Standards

**Format:** `category_descriptor` or `object_attribute`

**Examples:**
```yaml
source_tracking:
  - traffic_source
  - campaign_name
  - content_piece
  - term_keyword
  - referrer_domain

user_context:
  - user_segment
  - device_type
  - browser_name
  - session_count
  - page_location

transaction_details:
  - order_value
  - product_category
  - payment_method
  - discount_amount
  - shipping_method
```

### C.3 Value Standardization

**Boolean Values:** `true` / `false`
**Currency:** Always in cents (e.g., `1599` for $15.99)
**Dates:** ISO 8601 format (`YYYY-MM-DD`)
**Categories:** lowercase with underscores

## Research Methodology

### Input Analysis Process

**From Business Snapshot Analyst:**
- Current channel performance context
- Conversion funnel understanding
- Baseline metrics and goals

**From Offer Architect:**
- Key conversion events per offer

## Common KPI Definition Patterns

### Revenue-Focused Metrics
- **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR):** Sum of all monthly subscription values
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):** Average monthly revenue × average customer lifespan
- **Revenue Per Visitor (RPV):** Total revenue ÷ unique website visitors

### Conversion-Focused Metrics  
- **Lead Conversion Rate:** Customers ÷ leads × 100
- **Sales Funnel Velocity:** Average time from lead to customer
- **Cost Per Acquisition (CPA):** Total marketing spend ÷ new customers

### Engagement-Focused Metrics
- **Email Engagement Score:** (Opens × 1) + (Clicks × 3) + (Conversions × 10)
- **Content Performance Index:** (Views × 1) + (Shares × 5) + (Conversions × 20)
- **Customer Health Score:** Weighted average of usage, engagement, and satisfaction

## Attribution Model Options

### First-Touch Attribution
- **Best For:** Brand awareness and top-funnel optimization
- **Limitation:** Undervalues nurturing touchpoints

### Last-Touch Attribution  
- **Best For:** Direct response and conversion optimization
- **Limitation:** Ignores awareness and consideration influence

### Linear Attribution
- **Best For:** Understanding full customer journey
- **Limitation:** May overweight early touchpoints

### Time-Decay Attribution
- **Best For:** Balancing awareness and conversion influence
- **Limitation:** Requires sophisticated tracking setup

Remember: Perfect measurement is impossible - focus on directionally accurate, actionable metrics that improve decision-making quality.
