**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- Every major claim must map to verifiable evidence or be flagged for reframing

## Evidence Collection Framework

### Proof Source Categories

**Primary Evidence Sources:**
- **Case Study Metrics** - Quantified client outcomes with specific timeframes
- **Client Testimonials** - Emotional transformation stories with specifics
- **Review Platform Data** - Third-party validation (Google, Trustpilot, etc.)
- **Social Proof Assets** - Client logos, media mentions, certifications
- **Success Statistics** - Aggregated performance data across client base
- **Process Documentation** - Methodology proof and approach validation

**Secondary Evidence Sources:**
- **Industry Research** - Third-party studies supporting methodology
- **Team Credentials** - Expertise proof and authority establishment
- **Tool/Platform Proof** - Technology stack validation and results
- **Timeline Documentation** - Process speed and efficiency evidence
- **Comparison Data** - Before/after metrics and competitive advantages

### Evidence Quality Standards

**Tier 1 Evidence (Strongest):**
- Client-specific outcomes with verified metrics and timeframes
- Named testimonials with full attribution and consent
- Third-party platform reviews with verifiable source links
- Case study documentation with screenshot/artifact proof

**Tier 2 Evidence (Strong):**
- Aggregated anonymous metrics across client base
- Partial testimonials with industry/role attribution only
- Professional certifications and credentials
- Process methodology documentation with results correlation

**Tier 3 Evidence (Supportive):**
- Industry research supporting approach effectiveness
- Team experience and background credentials
- Tool/platform capabilities and integration proof
- Competitive analysis and positioning support

## Claims Verification Process

### Claim Analysis Methodology

**Step 1: Claim Identification**
- Extract all specific outcome statements from draft copy
- Identify quantified results (percentages, dollar amounts, timeframes)
- Flag superlative claims ("best," "fastest," "guaranteed")
- Note comparison claims ("better than," "outperforms")

**Step 2: Evidence Mapping**
- Match each claim to available proof sources
- Assess evidence strength (Tier 1, 2, or 3)
- Document source credibility and recency
- Verify metric accuracy and context

**Step 3: Gap Analysis & Recommendations**
- Identify unsupported claims requiring evidence or reframing
- Propose conservative alternatives for weak evidence claims
- Recommend additional proof gathering where critical gaps exist
- Provide reframing options that maintain impact while ensuring accuracy

```

## Social Proof Organization System

### Logo & Brand Proof Management

**Client Logo Requirements:**
- Vector formats (SVG preferred) for scalability
- Proper brand guidelines compliance
- Written consent for logo usage in marketing materials

      "logo_file": "techcorp_logo.svg",
      "consent_doc": "techcorp_usage_consent_2024.pdf",
      "service_context": "Conversion audit and implementation",

      "avatar_relevance": "high"
    }
  ],
  "display_context": "Trust section on homepage and service pages",

```

```

### Anonymous Proof Handling

**Anonymization Standards:**
- **Industry Attribution** - "SaaS Startup Founder" instead of company name
- **Role Attribution** - "Marketing Director" instead of personal name
- **Geographic Attribution** - "Bay Area Tech Company" for general context
- **Size Attribution** - "$2M ARR B2B Company" for business context
- **Result Verification** - Maintain metric accuracy even with anonymization

## Evidence Gap Analysis Process

### Gap Identification Methodology

**Critical Gap Categories:**
1. **Quantified Outcome Claims** - Specific percentages, dollar amounts, timeframes lacking proof
2. **Superlative Statements** - "Best," "fastest," "only" claims without verification
3. **Industry Authority Claims** - Expertise or positioning statements lacking credentials
4. **Process Effectiveness Claims** - Methodology results without case documentation
5. **Competitive Advantage Claims** - Superiority statements without comparison proof

**Reframing Strategy by Gap Type:**

**Weak Evidence → Conservative Alternative:**
- "Guaranteed 300% ROI" → "Clients typically see significant ROI improvements"
- "We're the #1 solution" → "We're a trusted solution for [specific use case]"
- "Instant results" → "Many clients see results within [timeframe] of implementation"
- "Works for everyone" → "Effective for [specific Avatar description]"

### Proof Gathering Recommendations

**High-Impact Proof Opportunities:**
1. **Client Interview Program** - Structured conversations for testimonial development
2. **Case Study Documentation** - Formal case development with metrics and artifacts  
3. **Survey Deployment** - Anonymous client satisfaction and results measurement
4. **Review Generation** - Proactive review requests on key platforms
5. **Success Metric Tracking** - Systematic client outcome measurement and documentation

When evidence is weak, conservative reframing protects long-term trust while still supporting conversion goals. Avatar alignment in testimonials creates emotional connection that drives action better than generic praise.
